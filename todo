todo list

hard bots:
  add a 'armor' command that toggles bots taking off their armor or not (kinda impossible bcz crash inventory interact)
  add a 'drop' command to make bots drop everything in their inventory (kinda impossible bcz crash inventory interact)
  auto leave when more than threshold joins the lobby?

silent bots/autogrinder:
  look at players and attack
  swap lobby until found player (if enabled otherwise just join party)
