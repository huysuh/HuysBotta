# HuysBotta
HuysBotta is a Bot for the Hypixel Pit coded in Mineflayer.js! 
Made by huys (small changes from ilylol & freemoneyhub)

### commands:
>play - makes bot join pit
>lobby - makes bot go to the lobby
>limbo - makes bots go to limbo (may have to be typed multiple times)
>findstart - starts the lobby finder
>findstop - stops the lobby finder
>lobbyfind - doesn't work (for silent bots which aren't made yet)
>party - sends the /p commands you need to type to party your bots
>warp - if the lobbyFinderIgn is party leader. makes the lobbyFinderIgn /play pit
>report <ign> - reports who you selected
>massreport - configure igns in the config. reports a group of people you define


### how to use the small lobby finder:
promote the bot that you set as "lobbyFinderIgn" at the top of the script. once promoted make all bots go to limbo. once in limbo type findstart and it will begin finding a lobby. it will automatically disable when you find a lobby but in the event you want to stop it for any reason typing /findstop should work
